# Manage Your Datasets
Rather than having many datasets (csv & txt) littering different folders all over your laptop or PC, you can save all the datasets in a folder, write them all to one single SQLite database file and manage them from there.
You can:
* add up more dataset to the database at any time.
* list and see all the datasets in the database at any time.
* check up the fields or columns that make up each dataset or table.
* load any dataset directly from the database.
* drop any dataset or table as you like.

How to do that? Follow the codes in this notebook.
