# Organize and Manage Your Datasets
As a data analyst or scientist, you probably have one or more datasets kept in different folders on your laptop or PC. To better organize the datasets, you can write them to one SQLite database file and manage them from there.  

With all your datasets in a single database file, you can:
* add up more dataset to the database at any time.
* list and see all the datasets in the database at any time.
* check up the fields or columns that make up each dataset or table.
* load any dataset directly from the database.
* drop any dataset or table as you like.

How to do that? Follow the codes in this jupyter notebook.
